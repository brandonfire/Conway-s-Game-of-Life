Welcome to Conway's game of Life.
The model is a rectangular grid in which each cell is either "alive" or "dead"
Each configuration evolves into a new configuration depending rules based on
the number of live neighbors

You will be prompted for the number of rows and columns in your grid
and then for the rules for the transformation of one configuration to the next

After that you will see a visual representation of the initial configuration

and repeatedly asked if you want to see the next generation (enter y for yes, n for no)

Enter the number of rows in your grid: Enter the number of columns in your grid: 
Enter the live neighbor counts (between 0 and 8) that will cause a dead cell 
to become alive in the next generation, terminating input with -1

Enter the live neighbor counts (between 0 and 8) that will cause a live cell 
to continue living in the next generation, terminating input with -1
List the coordinates for living cells.
Terminate the list with the special pair -1 -1
